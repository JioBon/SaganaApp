      "[{'Crop': 'Corn', 'Scientific': 'Zea mays', 'Stress': 'Leaf Spot', 'Description': 'Leaf spot is a common disease that affects corn plants. It is caused by several different fungal pathogens, including Helminthosporium spp., Cercospora spp., and Bipolaris spp.     Symptoms of leaf spot typically appear as small, circular lesions on the leaves, which can be surrounded by a yellow halo.        If left untreated, leaf spot can cause significant damage to corn plants, reducing yield and overall plant health.     To manage leaf spot, it is important to implement a combination of cultural and chemical control measures.    ', 'Solutions': \"To control leaf spot on corns, there are several methods that can be used, including chemical control, biological control, and cultural control.    Chemical Control: There are numerous fungicides available for control of Gray leaf spot.      However, there is no guarantee that fungicide applications will result in economic returns, especially if they are applied to highly resistant hybrids in fields with little disease.  For this reason it is important to scout fields for symptoms of Gray leaf spot and apply fungicides only when they are needed.  Scouts should pay particular attention to the lower three leaves of the corn plant from the period just before tasseling to two weeks after tasseling.  If at least 50% of plants in a field have disease present on the third leaf below the ear leaf or higher prior to tasseling, the hybrid is susceptible, and the conditions are favorable for disease, then a spray may be warranted.  Gray leaf spot severity is unpredictable and multiple factors should be considered when making the decision to use fungicides to control Gray leaf spot.  Always follow label directions when applying a fungicide.        Biological Control: Involves the use of natural enemies, such as beneficial microorganisms, to control leaf spot. One example of biological control is the use of biocontrol agents, such as Trichoderma spp., Bacillus spp., or Pseudomonas spp., which can colonize the plant's roots and leaves, and produce antifungal compounds that suppress the growth of leaf spot pathogens.        Cultural Control: Involves modifying the environment to make it less favorable for the development and spread of leaf spot. This can include practices such as crop rotation, planting resistant varieties, and sanitation. For example, removing infected plant debris and avoiding overhead irrigation can help reduce the spread of leaf spot. Other cultural practices that can help prevent leaf spot infections include planting corn in well-drained soil, avoiding planting corn in fields with a history of leaf spot infections and providing proper nutrition and avoiding over-fertilization, which can increase susceptibility to leaf spot.    \"}, {'Crop': 'Corn', 'Scientific': 'Zea mays', 'Stress': 'Powdery Mildew', 'Description': 'Powdery mildew is another common fungal disease that can affect corn plants. The disease is caused by the fungus Erysiphe orontii and appears as a white, powdery coating on the leaves, stalks, and tassels of the plant.

However, there is no guarantee that fungicide applications will result in economic returns, especially if they are applied to highly resistant hybrids in fields with little disease.  For this reason it is important to scout fields for symptoms of Gray leaf spot and apply fungicides only when they are needed.  Scouts should pay particular attention to the lower three leaves of the corn plant from the period just before tasseling to two weeks after tasseling.  If at least 50% of plants in a field have disease present on the third leaf below the ear leaf or higher prior to tasseling, the hybrid is susceptible, and the conditions are favorable for disease, then a spray may be warranted.  Gray leaf spot severity is unpredictable and multiple factors should be considered when making the decision to use fungicides to control Gray leaf spot.  Always follow label directions when applying a fungicide.        \\n\\nBiological Control: Involves the use of natural enemies, such as beneficial microorganisms, to control leaf spot. One example of biological control is the use of biocontrol agents, such as Trichoderma spp., Bacillus spp., or Pseudomonas spp., which can colonize the plant's roots and leaves, and produce antifungal compounds that suppress the growth of leaf spot pathogens.       \\n\\nCultural Control: Involves modifying the environment to make it less favorable for the development and spread of leaf spot.

Granular insecticides are also applied over the young plants because the particles fall deep into the whorl. Some resistance to insecticides has been noted, with resistance varying regionally.keeping the plants free of larvae during the vegetative period reduced the number of sprays needed during the silking period. The grower practice of concentrating the sprays at the beginning of the silking period instead of spacing the sprays evenly provided little benefit.   \\n\\nBiological Control: Although several pathogens have been shown experimentally to reduce the abundance of fall armyworm larvae in corn, only\\xa0Bacillus thuringiensis\\xa0presently is feasible, and success depends on having the product on the foliage when the larvae first appear. Natural strains of\\xa0Bacillus thuringiensis\\xa0tend not to be very potent, and genetically modified strains improve performance.  \\n\\nCultural Control: The most important cultural practice, employed widely in southern states, is early planting and/or early maturing varieties. Early harvest allows many corn ears to escape the higher armyworm densities that develop later in the season. Reduced tillage seems to have little effect on fall armyworm populations, although delayed invasion by moths of fields with extensive crop residue has been observed, thus delaying and reducing the need for chemical suppression.',\n",

These growths may later turn purple or brown as a result of a secondary infection of the lesion by other fungi,     such as those that cause PURPLE BLOTCH AND STEMPYLIUM LEAF BLIGHT, as these fungi can produce purple pigmentation and dark spores.

       "  'Solutions': 'There are several control methods available for managing Downy mildew in onions, including chemical, biological, and cultural control.        \\n\\nChemical Control: Spray at the first sign of the disease. After the first spray, scout fields and make subsequent applications when weather conditions are favorable for the disease.     Rotate with fungicides from different mode-of-action groups to reduce the risk of fungicide resistance development.     Fungicides may be applied on a 7-day schedule (only as consistent with the label), if necessary.     For all fungicides, thorough coverage of foliage is important in the control of downy mildew.     Apply appropriate foliar fungicides taking care to apply thoroughly to waxy leaves.     Chlorothalonil and mancozeb are the main protectant fungicides for downy mildew.        \\n\\nBiological Control: Seed treatment, as well as leaf spraying with Pseudomonas fluorescens, can be an effective measure for controlling downy mildew (4 to 5 g per kg of seed).     Seeds treated with this beneficial bacteria increase seedling strength and inhibit sporulation of the downy mildew pathogen.     Since the effectiveness is markedly higher, it is recommended to control downy mildew with P. fluorescens through seed treatment and leaf spraying.        \\n\\nCultural Control: Use a 3-year rotation away from Allium crops in fields where the disease has occurred.     Use disease-free bulbs, sets, and seed. Remove and destroy material of any Allium plants, including residue from the previous crop, volunteer plants, and culls from storage.     Avoid entering fields when leaves are wet. Avoid injuring the crop with herbicides and other.',\n",
