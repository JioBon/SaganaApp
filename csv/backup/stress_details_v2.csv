Corn,Spodoptera frugiperda,Scraping Damage of Armyworm,"Armyworms are the larvae of certain species of moths that can cause significant damage to corn crops. They are named for their behavior of moving in large groups and devouring everything in their path, much like an army on the march.        Armyworms are typically about 1-2 inches in length and can be brown, gray, or green in color. They have distinct stripes on their bodies that run the length of their back and sides. Armyworms feed on the leaves, stalks, and ears of corn plants, causing damage that can range from minor to severe.    ","To control Armyworm on corns, there are several methods that can be used, including chemical control, biological control, and cultural control.        

Cultural Control: Cultural control involves modifying the environment to make it less favorable for the development and spread of armyworms. This can include practices such as crop rotation, planting resistant varieties, and sanitation.     For example, removing crop residues and weeds from the field can help reduce the population of armyworms, planting corn early in the season to avoid peak armyworm activity. 

Biological Control: One example of biological control is the use of parasitic wasps or flies that lay their eggs in the armyworm's eggs or larvae, causing their death. Another example is the use of insect-killing fungi, such as Beauveria bassiana, which can infect and kill armyworms.        

Chemical Control: There are many insecticides available that can be used to control armyworms on corns, such as pyrethroids, carbamates, and organophosphates.

","To control White Flies on corns, there are several methods that can be used, including chemical control, biological control, and cultural control.          

Cultural Control:         
- Use varieties that are resistant to planthoppers.
- Grow early maturing varieties to have a rice-free period of more than 1 month to break pest cycle.
- Plow under ratoons and volunteer crops after harvest as these may serve as inoculum for viral diseases.
- Avoid dense planting in areas with history of recent planthopper infestations.
- Practice appropriate and balanced fertilizer application. Split nitrogen fertilizer into three applications during crop growth to reduce BPH build-up.
- Raise the level of irrigation water periodically to destroy the eggs that are deposited at the lower portions of tillers and in leaf sheaths.
- Intensify weeding to reduce hopper density. Straight row planting with proper spacing does not favor multiplication of planthoppers.
- Maintain low water level to enhance killing action of useful organisms

Biological Control: Useful organisms should be encouraged to build-up by avoiding early application of insecticides. Small wasps (e.g. Anagrus sp. and Oligosita sp.) attack eggs.
- Mirid bugs prey on eggs.
- Dragonflies and damselflies prey on nymphs and adults during flight.
- Spiders, water bugs, and lady beetles prey on nymphs and adults.
- Dryinids kill nymphs.
- Some entomophagous fungi kill nymphs and adults.          

Chemical Control: Applying insecticides when population is mostly young nymphs is wasteful because useful organisms usually keep their numbers under control.
- Indiscriminate use of insecticides causes BPH resurgence.

Corn,Spodoptera frugiperda,Frass of Armyworm,"Armyworm frass refers to dark-colored waste produced by armyworm larvae while feeding. It presents as granular or pellet-like droppings on leaves stems, or the ground. The presence of frass suggests the existence of armyworms and their activity.

Armyworms are the larval stage of moths from the Noctuidae family. These larvae can grow up to 2 inches long and curl up when disturbed. Although they eventually develop into moths, the most significant damage is caused by the larval stage. Armyworms get their name from their behavior when they occur in large numbers, resembling an army battalion. They can quickly devastate lawn grasses and crops, particularly rice-strain and corn-strain plants. Signs of armyworm infestation include chewed leaves with scalloped edges, ""skeletonized"" leaves on crops like lettuce, cabbage, beans, corn, and shallow gouges in tomato fruits. Corn is particularly susceptible, with the worms feeding on leaf whorls and burrowing into the ears. Early-season corn is especially vulnerable.
source: https://www.planetnatural.com/pest-problem-solver/garden-pests/armyworm-control/","There are several control methods available for managing Armyworm frass on corn, including chemical, biological, and cultural control. 

Cultural Control: Modifying the environment to make it less hospitable to armyworms. One effective way is to practice crop rotation. By alternating corn with non-host crops, armyworm populations are reduced as they are deprived of their preferred food source. Removing crop residues after harvest can also help reduce overwintering populations of armyworms.

Biological Control
Biological control methods use natural enemies to control pest populations. One effective way is to introduce parasitic wasps, such as the braconid wasp, which lays its eggs inside the armyworm larvae. The wasp larvae then feed on the armyworm, killing it. Another biological control method is introducing predators, such as birds, which feed on armyworms.

Chemical Control
Chemical control methods involve the use of insecticides to kill armyworms. However, it is essential to use these chemicals judiciously, as they can also harm beneficial insects and pollinators. One effective chemical control method is Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) insecticide. It is a naturally occurring bacterium that produces a protein toxic to armyworms but harmless to humans and other animals.

Corn,Peregrinus maidis,Corn Plant Hopper Egg Mass,"The egg mass of the Corn Planthopper is elongated, white or yellowish-white in color, and arranged in rows on the undersides of corn leaves. These small eggs, measuring about 0.5 mm in length, are challenging to detect without magnification. Typically, an egg mass contains around 10-30 eggs and is coated with a protective waxy secretion that safeguards the eggs from predators and drying out.

Controlling the egg mass of the Corn Planthopper is crucial in managing this pest, as it is a significant threat to corn crops and can cause substantial yield losses. By targeting and managing the egg stage, farmers can help prevent further damage to their crops.","There are several control methods available for managing Corn Planthopper Egg Mass on corn, including chemical, biological, and cultural control. 

Cultural Control: Cultural control methods aim to manage the environment and cultural practices to reduce the risk of Corn Planthopper (CPH) infestation. These methods include rotating the crops can help break the pest's life cycle, reduce its population, and prevent the buildup of infestation. Removing the crop residues after harvest can help eliminate the overwintering sites for CPH and other pests. Planting early or late can help avoid peak CPH activity and reduce the risk of infestation. Controlling weeds and other host plants can help reduce the populations of CPH and prevent their spread.

Biological Control: Biological treatments are effective when the population density of the planthopper is low. The pest can be controlled by utilizing natural enemies such as water striders, mirid bugs, spiders, and various parasitoid wasps and flies that prey on the insect. Flooding the seedbed for a short period, allowing only the seedling tips to be exposed, can also help manage the planthopper population through a method known as drowning. Another approach is to sweep small seedbeds with a net to capture the insects. These strategies provide environmentally friendly alternatives to control the planthopper.

Chemical Control: It is important to adopt an integrated approach that combines preventive measures with biological treatments, if possible. Insecticides should only be considered when there are significant populations of planthoppers or when natural enemies are insufficient. Selective insecticides such as buprofezin, pymetrozine, etofenprox, or alternating compounds can be used against the pest. However, it is advisable to avoid chemicals like quinalphos, chlorpyriphos, lambda-cyhalothrin, or other synthetic pyrethroid combinations as they can promote resistance development and the resurgence of the insect. Taking these precautions can help manage the brown planthopper effectively while minimizing the negative impacts on the environment.

Eggplant,Helicoverpa zea,Earworm," Earworm is a highly damaging crop pest, considered one of the most costly. It commonly attacks valuable crops and the harvested portions of plants. The larvae can be found feeding on blossoms, buds, and fruits. In corn, they feed on silks, interfering with pollination, and later gain kernel access. This feeding can lead to fungal infections. They may also burrow directly into the ear, remaining within a single ear or occasionally searching for another. The larvae can also damage young leaf tissue in corn plants at the whorl stage. In tomato plants, they feed on foliage, burrow into the stems, and primarily target the fruit. They often move from one fruit to another, causing damage. Other crops like eggplants, beans, cantaloupes, cucumbers, squash, and pumpkins can also be affected similarly. The presence of silking corn nearby can influence their oviposition preference.","There are several control methods available for managing Earworm on eggplants, including chemical, biological, and cultural control.

Cultural Control: Trap cropping is a recommended method, using crops preferred by corn earworm moths to lure them away from main crops. However, maintaining attractant crops for extended periods can be challenging. Controlling weeds through mowing, herbicides, or insecticides can reduce damage to nearby crops in areas where populations develop on weed hosts before moving to crops. Early planting or harvesting can also help minimize injury, especially in northern regions. Autumn tillage can significantly reduce the overwintering success of pupae in southern areas.

Biological Control: Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) bacteria and certain nematodes can provide some suppression of corn earworms. When applied to corn silk, entomopathogenic nematodes can effectively suppress larval development, particularly in home garden settings. Soil applications of nematodes can also impact earworm populations as larvae drop into the soil to pupate. However, complete larval development is necessary before effective control is achieved, resulting in some crop damage.

Chemical Control: Insecticides are commonly used for corn earworm control. Liquid formulations are applied to foliage, emphasizing the ear zone and silk. Applications are typically made at intervals of two to six days and sometimes more frequently. Resistance to insecticides is a concern, as corn earworm has developed resistance to many chemicals due to frequent and widespread use. Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) susceptibility varies, and the factors contributing to this variation are not fully understood. In-home gardens, mineral oil, can be applied to corn silk after pollination to provide effective control. Applying around 0.75 to 1.0 ml of oil five to seven days after silking is recommended.

Biological control: One effective method is to apply a biofungicide containing Bacillus subtilis, a beneficial bacterium that can prevent black mold from spreading. Another option is to use predatory mites, such as Phytoseiulus persimilis or Neoseiulus californicus, which feed on black mold and other plant pests.         

Chemical control: There are several fungicides available that can control black mold on tomato plants, including copper fungicides, sulfur fungicides, and fungicides containing triadimefon or myclobutanil. Follow the instructions on the fungicide label carefully, as overuse or misuse can lead to plant damage or residue on the tomatoes. Avoid applying fungicides during the hottest part of the day or when the plants are water-stressed.",Fungus,Leaves,Vegetative Stage
Tomato,Fusarium oxysporum,Fusarium Wilt,"Fusarium wilt is a common fungal disease that affects tomato plants. The disease is caused by the fungus Fusarium oxysporum and can be devastating to tomato crops.     Symptoms of fusarium wilt on tomato plants usually begin with yellowing and wilting of the lower leaves, which may appear to be scattered throughout the plant. The yellowing may progress to the entire plant, causing it to wilt and eventually die.        The fungus can survive in the soil for several years, making crop rotation an important management strategy. Fusarium wilt can also be transmitted through infected seeds, transplants, and soil. The fungus invades the roots of the tomato plant, interfering with the uptake of water and nutrients, which can lead to wilting and eventual death.    ","To control Fusarium Wilt on tomato, there are several methods that can be used, including chemical control, biological control, and cultural control.    

Cultural control: Planting resistant tomato varieties that are less susceptible to fusarium wilt. Rotating crops, as the fungus can survive in the soil for several years and infect future tomato crops. Removing and destroying infected plants and any plant debris that can harbor the fungus. Avoiding overwatering and watering at the base of the plants rather than overhead watering, which can promote fungal growth. Using sterilized soil or soilless growing media to start seedlings. Applying organic matter, such as compost, to the soil to promote a healthy microbial community.    

Biological control: One effective method is to use soil-borne beneficial microorganisms, such as Trichoderma spp. or Bacillus subtilis, which can suppress the growth of the fungus that causes fusarium wilt. Another option is to use soil solarization, a process that involves covering the soil with plastic to trap heat and kill the fungus.         

Chemical control: There are no chemicals available to cure fusarium wilt, but some fungicides can help reduce the severity of the disease. Fungicides containing chlorothalonil, mancozeb, or copper can help protect plants from fungal infections. Follow the instructions on the fungicide label carefully, as overuse or misuse can lead to plant damage or residue on the tomatoes.

Lyriomyza spp.",Leaf Miner,"Leaf miner is a common pest that affects tomato plants, as well as many other plants. The pest is a small, flying insect that lays eggs on the surface of the tomato plant leaves. When the eggs hatch, the larvae tunnel into the leaves, creating winding, white or yellowish-brown tracks or tunnels. These tunnels can cause significant damage to the leaves, interfering with the plant's ability to photosynthesize and produce healthy fruit.        In addition to the visible tunnels, leaf miner damage can cause the leaves to become distorted or curled, which can further impact the plant's health. Severe infestations can result in stunted growth and reduced yield. Leaf miners typically thrive in warm, humid conditions, and can be difficult to control once established.    ","To control Leaf Miner on tomato, there are several methods that can be used, including chemical control, biological control, and cultural control.    

Cultural control: Removing and destroying any infected leaves or plant debris that can harbor the insects. Using reflective mulches or coatings, such as aluminum foil or silver plastic, which can confuse the leaf miners and reduce their attraction to the plants. Using yellow sticky traps, which can attract and trap adult leaf miner flies. Planting resistant tomato varieties that are less susceptible to leaf miners.

Biological control: Biological control involves the use of natural enemies to control leaf miners. One effective method is to release parasitic wasps, such as Diglyphus spp. or Chrysocharis spp., which lay their eggs in the leaf miner larvae, killing them. Another option is to use predatory mites, such as Phytoseiulus persimilis or Neoseiulus californicus, which feed on leaf miners and other plant pests.         

Chemical control: There are several insecticides available that can control leaf miners on tomato plants, including spinosad, abamectin, and cyromazine. Follow the instructions on the insecticide label carefully, as overuse or misuse can lead to plant damage or residue on the tomatoes. Avoid applying insecticides during the hottest part of the day or when the plants are water-stressed.","Insect, Pest",Leaves,Vegetative Stage
