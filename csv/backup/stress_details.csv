Corn,Zea mays,Leaf Spot,"Leaf spot is a common disease that affects corn plants. It is caused by several different fungal pathogens, including Helminthosporium spp., Cercospora spp., and Bipolaris spp.     Symptoms of leaf spot typically appear as small, circular lesions on the leaves, which can be surrounded by a yellow halo.        If left untreated, leaf spot can cause significant damage to corn plants, reducing yield and overall plant health.     To manage leaf spot, it is important to implement a combination of cultural and chemical control measures.    ","To control leaf spot on corns, there are several methods that can be used, including chemical control, biological control, and cultural control. 

Chemical Control: There are numerous fungicides available for control of Gray leaf spot.      However, there is no guarantee that fungicide applications will result in economic returns, especially if they are applied to highly resistant hybrids in fields with little disease.  For this reason it is important to scout fields for symptoms of Gray leaf spot and apply fungicides only when they are needed.  Scouts should pay particular attention to the lower three leaves of the corn plant from the period just before tasseling to two weeks after tasseling.  If at least 50% of plants in a field have disease present on the third leaf below the ear leaf or higher prior to tasseling, the hybrid is susceptible, and the conditions are favorable for disease, then a spray may be warranted.  Gray leaf spot severity is unpredictable and multiple factors should be considered when making the decision to use fungicides to control Gray leaf spot.  Always follow label directions when applying a fungicide.        

Biological Control: Involves the use of natural enemies, such as beneficial microorganisms, to control leaf spot. One example of biological control is the use of biocontrol agents, such as Trichoderma spp., Bacillus spp., or Pseudomonas spp., which can colonize the plant's roots and leaves, and produce antifungal compounds that suppress the growth of leaf spot pathogens.       

Cultural Control: Involves modifying the environment to make it less favorable for the development and spread of leaf spot. This can include practices such as crop rotation, planting resistant varieties, and sanitation. For example, removing infected plant debris and avoiding overhead irrigation can help reduce the spread of leaf spot. Other cultural practices that can help prevent leaf spot infections include planting corn in well-drained soil, avoiding planting corn in fields with a history of leaf spot infections and providing proper nutrition and avoiding over-fertilization, which can increase susceptibility to leaf spot.

Corn,Zea mays,Corn Borer,"Corn borers are a common pest that can cause significant damage to corn crops. They are the larvae of moths that lay their eggs on the leaves of corn plants. When the eggs hatch, the larvae burrow into the stalks or ears of the corn plant and feed on the tissue inside.    Corn borer damage can cause the plant to become stunted and weakened, and it can also make the plant more susceptible to other pests and diseases. The damage can also lead to yield losses if left unchecked.    ","To control Corn Borer on corns, there are several methods that can be used, including chemical control, biological control, and cultural control.         

Chemical Control: There are several insecticides that are effective against corn borers, including chlorpyrifos, bifenthrin, and cypermethrin. It is important to follow the label instructions carefully and apply insecticides when corn borers are in their most susceptible stages.        

Biological Control: One such natural enemy is the Trichogramma wasp, which lays its eggs in the eggs of corn borers, preventing them from hatching. Another natural enemy is the Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) bacterium, which produces a toxin that is lethal to corn borers.        

Cultural Control: Cultural control involves using practices that make the environment less favorable for corn borers. Some strategies include choosing corn hybrids that have been bred for resistance to corn borers can reduce the need for chemical or biological control, planting corn early or late in the season can reduce the risk of corn borer infestations, and plowing or disking the soil can disrupt corn borer overwintering sites and reduce populations.

Corn,Zea mays,corn plant hopper,"Peregrinus maidis, commonly known as the corn planthopper, is a species of insect in the order Hemiptera and the family Delphacidae.It is widespread throughout most tropical and subtropical regions on earth, including southern North America, South America, Africa, Australia, Southeast Asia and China. P. maidis are a commercially important pest of maize and its relatives.In addition to physical plant damage, P. maidis is the vector for several species-specific maize viruses, including maize stripe virus, maize mosaic virusmand the non-pathogenic Peregrinus maidis reovirus.   ","To control White Flies on corns, there are several methods that can be used, including chemical control, biological control, and cultural control.          

Chemical Control: Applying insecticides when population is mostly young nymphs is wasteful because useful organisms usually keep their numbers under control.
• Indiscriminate use of insecticides causes BPH resurgence.
• Selective insecticides can also be used on strategic areas with very high population. However, proper application must be observed. 

Biological Control: Useful organisms should be encouraged to build-up by avoiding early application of insecticides. Small wasps (e.g. Anagrus sp. and Oligosita sp.) attack eggs.
• Mirid bugs prey on eggs.
• Dragonflies and damselflies prey on nymphs and adults during flight.
• Spiders, water bugs, and lady beetles prey on nymphs and adults.
• Dryinids kill nymphs.
• Some entomophagous fungi kill nymphs and adults.          

Cultural Control: • Use varieties that are resistant to planthoppers.
• Grow early maturing varieties to have a rice-free period of more than 1 month to break pest cycle.
• Plow under ratoons and volunteer crops after harvest as these may serve as inoculum for viral diseases.
• Avoid dense planting in areas with history of recent planthopper infestations.
• Practice appropriate and balanced fertilizer application. Split nitrogen fertilizer into three applications during crop growth to reduce BPH build-up.
• Raise the level of irrigation water periodically to destroy the eggs that are deposited at the lower portions of tillers and in leaf sheaths.
• Intensify weeding to reduce hopper density. Straight row planting with proper spacing does not favor multiplication of planthoppers.
• Maintain low water level to enhance killing action of useful organisms","pest, insect",Leaves,"Affects flowering, fruiting, seedling and vegetative growing stages of the plants"
Corn,Zea mays,corn borer midrib feeding,"Corn borer midrib feeding is a type of damage caused by the larvae of the corn borer moth that feed on the midrib of corn leaves. The midrib is the central vein that runs through the center of the leaf.        When corn borer larvae feed on the midrib of corn leaves, they can cause significant damage to the plant. The feeding can cause the leaves to wilt and curl, and it can also make the plant more susceptible to other pests and diseases.        The larvae of the corn borer moth are usually about 1 inch long and can be light pink or greenish-white in color. They can be found feeding on the midrib and inside the stalks or ears of the corn plant.    "," To control Corn borer midrib feeding on corns, there are several methods that can be used, including chemical control, biological control, and cultural control.

Corn,Zea mays,fall armyworm eggs,"The egg is dome shaped; the base is flattened and the egg curves upward to a broadly rounded point at the apex. The egg measures about 0.4 mm in diameter and 0.3 mm in height. The number of eggs per mass varies considerably but is often 100 to 200, and total egg production per female averages about 1500 with a maximum of over 2000. The eggs are sometimes deposited in layers, but most eggs are spread over a single layer attached to foliage. The female also deposits a layer of grayish scales between the eggs and over the egg mass, imparting a furry or moldy appearance. Duration of the egg stage is only two to three days during the summer months."," To control Corn borer midrib feeding on corns, there are several methods that can be used, including chemical control, biological control, and cultural control.          

Chemical Control: Insecticides are usually applied to sweet corn in the southeastern states to protect against damage by fall armyworm, sometimes as frequently as daily during the silking stage. Insecticides may be applied in the irrigation water if it is applied from overhead sprinklers. Granular insecticides are also applied over the young plants because the particles fall deep into the whorl. Some resistance to insecticides has been noted, with resistance varying regionally.keeping the plants free of larvae during the vegetative period reduced the number of sprays needed during the silking period. The grower practice of concentrating the sprays at the beginning of the silking period instead of spacing the sprays evenly provided little benefit.   

Biological Control: Although several pathogens have been shown experimentally to reduce the abundance of fall armyworm larvae in corn, only Bacillus thuringiensis presently is feasible, and success depends on having the product on the foliage when the larvae first appear. Natural strains of Bacillus thuringiensis tend not to be very potent, and genetically modified strains improve performance.  

Cultural Control: The most important cultural practice, employed widely in southern states, is early planting and/or early maturing varieties. Early harvest allows many corn ears to escape the higher armyworm densities that develop later in the season. Reduced tillage seems to have little effect on fall armyworm populations, although delayed invasion by moths of fields with extensive crop residue has been observed, thus delaying and reducing the need for chemical suppression.","pest, insect",Leaves,"fruiting, vegetative stage"
Corn,Zea mays,adult armyworm,"Armyworms are the heavy-bodied larvae of moths in the family Noctuidae. These nocturnal flyers lay eggs that hatch small larvae, which grow up to 2 inches long and curl up when disturbed. The larvae feed in large numbers, distinguishing them from the cutworm, which feeds singly. While they have varying appearances based on their species, all army caterpillars have a distinctive inverted Y mark on their heads. Egg-laying sites include agricultural crops and the grass blades of pasture grasses, and cool-season grasses. Any plant that is a corn strain or rice strain may be susceptible."," To control Corn borer midrib feeding on corns, there are several methods that can be used, including chemical control, biological control, and cultural control.          

Chemical Control: Azadirachtin sprays are also quite useful as a method for killing armyworms. Azadirachtin, the naturally-occurring active ingredient that makes neem oil so effective, smothers most eggs of these worms and kills the larvae. Other horticultural oils like neem oil are also effective against armyworms but have lesser amounts of azadirachtin than a pure form of neem oil does. A spinosad spray is just as effective as the other recommendations listed. Like Bt and azadirachtin, it works against multiple pests including the entire caterpillar family, asparagus beetles, and potato bugs. Ensure you follow the label and instructions for each insecticide’s intended use. 

Biological Control: An excellent choice for control is two strains of BT spray: Bacillus thuringiensis var. kurstaki and Bacillus thuringiensis var. aizawai. Available in both a liquid formula in sprays and a powdered version, these bacteria poison caterpillars. They’re effective not only on fall armyworms and others, but on other caterpillars such as cabbage loopers, cabbage worms, tomato hornworms, and cutworms. Beneficial nematodes help from within the soil. These microscopic soil-dwellers feast on the pupae of fall armyworms.  Nematodes on the soil surface attack larvae that may be burrowing down to pupate. But they’re not as effective on the soil’s surface unless it’s moist.

Cultural Control: There are a surprising number of armyworm predators. Cultivating natural enemies is a great integrated pest management strategy, even more than using organic methods. Among these predators are birds, especially crows, starlings, and bobolinks. Some frogs and toads also happily consume worms and adult moths. If you’ve been asking how to get rid of armyworms in grass, especially for your lawn or grain crops, attract these natural predators. However, birds may also pick at grain crops, so place bird netting over your crops if they become a problem.","pest, insect","Leaves, Stem",vegetative stage
